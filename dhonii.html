                            Dhoni's cricket career
MS Dhoni entered the international cricket scene in 2004 when he played for India against Bangladesh. Later that year, he was chosen for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. In 2006, he made his Test debut against Sri Lanka and ODI debut against West Indies. He has been a regular member since then. MS Dhoni’s performance in the 2007 T20 World Cup brought him to prominence. He was named team captain for the tournament, leading them to victory against Pakistan in the final. In 2008, he became captain of India’s ODI team as well, thus making him the youngest captain in history.
